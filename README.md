# virtual-dogsitter
We want to create an app that rewards a dog for it's actions while the owner(s) are away. If the owner sees that the dog is doing something wrong, they can press a button to play a loud noise to discourage them from doing what they're doing. If the dog is behaving well, then the owner can press a button that plays a message saying "Good Job."
If the dog misbehaves, there will be a loud noise that will frighten the dog and prevent them from acting wrongly in the future.
